packer
====

Packer is for creating machine and container images and it does a nice job of it.  In our case here we are developing Amazon Machine Images for use with [terraform] and [cform].  Right now I've stood up [salt-masterless] but eventually the plan is to test out provisioning with chef-solo and ansible as well.
