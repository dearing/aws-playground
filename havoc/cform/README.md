Cloud Formation templates
====

Deploying havoc with cloud formation with two philosophies: [nested] and [consolidated].  They are unfinished at this time because I'm honestly tired of messing with them.  After working with terraform, manipulating the json data for cform feels terrible and sluggish.

`more later...`

[nested]: nested/
[consolidated]: consolidated/
